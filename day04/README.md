## Part 1

I asked ChatGPT to create a unit test first, then the implementation. The test suite didn't pass but the puzzle input was correct. I gave it opportunity to fix the test case but it gave a different, incorrect answer.

I asked it for some quotes for its experience of the puzzle:

"I'm writing a small blog post to summarise our conversation about this puzzle. I'd like to quote you in it. How would you describe this puzzle from your perspective?"

> From my perspective, this puzzle involves finding pairs of assignments where one assignment is fully contained by the other in a list of assignment pairs. The input is a slice of strings representing the section assignment pairs, and the output is the number of pairs that have one assignment fully contained by the other. To solve the puzzle, we need to parse the input, compare the assignments in each pair, and count the number of pairs that have one assignment fully contained by the other.

"And how well do you think we worked together to find the solution to the puzzle?"

> I think we worked well together to find the solution to the puzzle. We went through the prompt and the test cases step by step, and I provided explanations and suggestions for how to fix the mistakes in the code. I also provided updated versions of the code that fixed the mistakes, and we were able to arrive at a correct solution together.

## Part 2

Part 2 was super duper piss easy and GPT solved it in one try.

## Solving without code

I tried providing the puzzle description and the puzzle input only to ChatGPT and asking it to return the answer, but it wasn't able to. Here was my prompt:

> I'm going to provide a puzzle to you. Once you've understood the puzzle, just say "Understood". I'll then provide the input to the puzzle. When I've provided the input, please return the solution to the puzzle. You shoudn't send the puzzle input back to me at any time.

My first few attempts, it just explained the puzzle to me. It also kept returning the puzzle input. The answer it provided was miles out.
